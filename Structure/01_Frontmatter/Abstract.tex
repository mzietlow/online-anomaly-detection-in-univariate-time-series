\begin{abstract}
    In this paper, 19 anomaly detection methods (available from open
    source libraries) are evaluated on the \acrfull{nab}-dataset. Evaluation metrics
    include the numenta standard- and F1-Score. Besides metrics, a visual
    examination and comparison of the algorithms is attempted. At it, the
    author faced issues inherent with \acrshort{nab}, including a lack of
    variability. Finally, the author argues that in the future
    a more dynamic process of visual evaluation should be constructed that might
    require dynamic generation of time series to more reliably confirm --- or
    falsify claims about discussed algorithms.
