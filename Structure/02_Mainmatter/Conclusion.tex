\section{Conclusion}\label{sect:conclusion}
Time series from \gls{nab} are not able to answer specific questions on the
behavior of algorithms

\subsection{Future Work}
\gls{ndt} contains a scoring mechanism for anomalies, that could be improved
to be able to rate anomalies. \gls{nab} is unfit to ``fence'' off algorithms
and explain their behavior visually.
